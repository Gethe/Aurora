Aurora [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Gethe/Aurora.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Gethe/Aurora)
======

** THIS VERSION OF AURORA IS A NOT FEATURE COMPLETE FOR TWW. MANY FEATURES ARE DISABLED/NOT SKINNED **

Aurora is an addon that restyles the default Blizzard interface to a clean, minimalistic theme that is consistent across the entire UI.

A lot of time has been spent on not only basic development and updates, but also refining and perfecting the appearance of each window and every frame.

A single color that matches your current class or is a color of your choosing is used for highlights and emphasis.

Options
-------

Open the Aurora options from the in-game addon options, or type /aurora.
